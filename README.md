# ðŸ“Š Content-Performance-Project

This project analyzes Netflix's global content library using a dataset of over 6,200 titles. It combines SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to uncover insights on content type, genre, rating, country distribution, and yearly trends.

<br>
Two Power BI dashboards were developed. The Overview Dashboard displays total content count, top genres, ratings, country-level distribution, and filters for month and year. The Detailed Dashboard allows deeper exploration by title, cast, director, and genre, and includes trends by year and metadata display for selected shows.

<br>
A separate Tableau dashboard offers interactive visuals showing content ratings, genre trends, and growth by country and year, with filters for type and rating.
<br>
<br>
SQL was used for data cleaning and analysis, including calculating totals, extracting genres, handling durations, and building subqueries for deeper insights. The cleaned dataset was prepared in Excel and imported into Power BI and Tableau.

Overall, the project provides a visual and data-driven overview of Netflixâ€™s content strategy, highlighting popular genres, dominant ratings, and how content has expanded over time.
